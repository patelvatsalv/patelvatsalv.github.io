			<p align="justify"> Hello! I'm a robotics / mechanical engineering PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/">GRAB Lab </a> at Yale University advised by Prof. Aaron M. Dollar. I work on developing robot hands that can manipulate everyday objects in complex tasks through novel mechanical designs, parallel mechanisms, motion planning, and optimization! I graduated with bachelors (w/ <a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2017-18-DEPARTMENTAL-CITATION-RECIPIENTS_updated.pdf/">Dept Citation</a>!) and masters from University of California, Berkeley. In summer 2023, I was a research intern at the <a href="https://theaiinstitute.com/">Boston Dynamics AI Institute</a>. </p>
