			<p> Hello! I'm a robotics / mechanical engineering PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/">GRAB Lab </a> at Yale University advised by Prof. Aaron M. Dollar. I work on developing robot hands and sensor architechtures to manipulate everyday objects in unstructured tasks without complex control. </p>
			
			<p> In the past, I was a research intern at the <a href="https://rai-inst.com/">Robotics & AI Institute</a> and part of the 2025 cohort of <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2025/participants">RSS Pioneers</a>. I have also worked at <a href="https://www.intuitive.com/en-us">Intuitive Surgical</a>, and taught as an (<a href="https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/ogsi-recipients-2018-2019/">"outstanding"</a>) graduate student instructor and teaching fellow. At Yale, I have provided technical insights to <a href="https://ventures.yale.edu/about/fellows-associates">Yale Ventures</a>, and helped build community and mentorships through many engineering and campus-wide groups. Prior to Yale, I got my bachelors (with <a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2017-18-DEPARTMENTAL-CITATION-RECIPIENTS_updated.pdf">dept citation</a>) and masters from University of California, Berkeley. </p>
